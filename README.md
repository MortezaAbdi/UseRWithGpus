# Use GPUs with R

These are the sample code and installer mentioned in my [GPU-Powered Computing for Data Science with R Notebooks on Google Cloudâ€™s AI Platform Notebooks \[DC91511\]](https://events.rainfocus.com/widget/nvidia/gtcdc19/catalog-short?search=zain) talk [[recording](https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtcdc/2019/video/dc91511-gpu-powered-computing-for-data-science-with-r-notebooks-on-google-clouds-ai-platform/)] at Nvidia GTC 2019. The talk covered various ways to speed up your data analysis for AI and ML workflows, with a focus on optimizing GPU usage

This repository contains consists of installation scripts to easily install R on Jupyter Notebooks (like AI Platform Notebooks).

The notebooks contain code that shows how easy it is to perform various Machine Learning/Deep Learning actions on CPU based notebooks versus GPU based notebooks, and you can use the installation script to add R support to any of the existing AI Platform Notebooks

This blog post describes the installation script in more detail: https://zainrizvi.io/blog/using-gpus-with-r-in-jupyter-lab/
