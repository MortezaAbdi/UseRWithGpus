These are the sample code and installer mentioned in my [GPU-Powered Computing for Data Science with R Notebooks on Google Cloudâ€™s AI Platform Notebooks \[DC91511\]](https://events.rainfocus.com/widget/nvidia/gtcdc19/catalog-short?search=zain) talk at Nvidia GTC 2019

It consists of installation scripts to easily install R on AI Platform Notebooks.  

The notebooks contain code that shows how easy it is to perform various Machine Learning/Deep Learning actions on CPU based notebooks versus GPU based notebooks, and you can use the installation script to add R support to any of the existing AI Platform Notebooks
